# Attentive Region Embedding Network for Zero-shot Learning (CVPR 2019)
## For reproducing purpose on CUB:PS ZSL results!

![](../master/fig2_v711.png)


1. This code is used for reproducing the results in our CVPR 2019 paper:  Attentive Region Embedding Network for Zero-shot Learning

2. The style of the codes is the same as the ImageNet training example in official Pytorch website. 

3. If you use our code, please cite our paper: Guo-Sen Xie et al., Attentive Region Embedding Network for Zero-shot Learning, in
CVPR19.

4. As an example, We provide a trained model (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EIuOPi0MjdKUD7mtKlFkbaMF7tCsYedV/view?usp=sharing) of ARE on CUB:PS setting for ZSL. The default parameters in main.py will achieve 72.7% ZSL result on CUB.
