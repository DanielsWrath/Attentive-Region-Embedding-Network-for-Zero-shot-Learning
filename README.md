# Attentive-Region-Embedding-Network-for-Zero-shot-Learning
for reproducing purpose on CUB:PS ZSL results!

1. This code is used for reproducing the results in our CVPR 2019 paper:  Attentive Region Embedding Network for Zero-shot Learning

2. The style of the codes is the same as the ImageNet training example in official Pytorch website. 

3. If you use our code, please cite our paper: Guo-Sen Xie et al., Attentive Region Embedding Network for Zero-shot Learning, in
CVPR19.

4. We provide a trained model (xxxxxx) of ARE on CUB:PS setting for ZSL. The default parameters will achieve 72.7% ZSL result on CUB.
